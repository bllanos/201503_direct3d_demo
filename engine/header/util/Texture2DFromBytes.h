Description
  -A Texture class encapsulating texture creation from in-memory data
  -Note that textures are created CPU read-only,
     but with GPU read and write access.
  -Note that the Direct3D device context will automatically
     unbind resources from their existing bind locations
	 before adding a conflicting bind location (e.g. to prevent
	 a resource being bound for reading and writing simultaneously).

	 However, the Direct3D device debug layer
	 will still output warnings in these cases.

  -The texture has a DXGI format of DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT
     and a single mip level.

	   at all locations where it was currently bound,
	   although it will result in warnings being output

	   'depthStencilView' is the depth stencil to set along
	   with the render target (as the OMSetRenderTargets()
	   method of the device context simultaneously sets the
	   depth stencil texture). If null, the current
	   depth stencil view is used instead.

	   I am not sure if calling OMSetRenderTargets() with a null

	   stencil state, but have assumed this to be the case,
