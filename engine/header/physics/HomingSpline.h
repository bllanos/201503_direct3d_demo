Primary basis: WanderingLineSpline.h

Description
  -Narrows the functionality of the Spline class to produce a spline
     between two endpoints (Transformable objects).
  -At construction, WanderingLineTransformable objects are used
     to create a static (except for the last knot)
	 spline which wanders between the two endpoints.
  -The spline will add static knots just before its end,
     using the current position and forward direction
	 of the end Transformable, when the end Transformable
	 has moved beyond a threshold distance from the second-last knot.
  -The end Transformable is always the last (and dynamic) knot in the spline.

Notes:
  -Be sure to understand the getParameterAtInitialSize()
     and getParamterAtFinalSize() functions and why they are useful.

	   random value.

	   'capacity' and 'initialSize' must both be greater than zero
	   or the constructor will throw an exception.

	   'start' and 'end' define the ends of the spline.

	   'thresholdDistance' is the distance by which the 'end'
	   Transformable must move before a new knot is added
	   to the spline to capture its recent motion, and must be greater than zero.
