Description
  -A non-instantiable base class defining a cubic Bezier spline

Implementation Notes:
  -Remember that a spline cannot be defined until it contains
     at least one segment.
  -Treat a spline with a single knot as a special case
     in all applicable member functions.
	 Invariant: In a spline with one knot, the knot is a two-sided knot.
	 Invariant: In a spline with more than one knot,
	   the first knot is a single-sided START knot,
	   and the last knot is a single-sided END knot.
	   All other knots are two-sided (BOTH).
